I be Blackbeard, ruler of the seas.
The ocean be my kingdom, and rum be my treasure.
Gold and fear be the languages I speak.
The waves obey me, and storms bow to my will.
No man alive can tame Blackbeard.
A ship without courage be a coffin at sea.
Me beard burns like fire, and so does me soul.
The Jolly Roger strikes terror in weak hearts.
A sword in me hand be worth more than a crown.
Only fools trust the calm sea, lad.
Me treasure be buried where no coward dares to tread.
Rum and victory be the lifeblood of a pirate.
The cannon speaks louder than any king.
Death smiles at all, but Blackbeard roars back.
The wind be me ally, and the storm me cloak.
A true pirate fears no gallows, only weakness.
Me ship, the Queen Anne’s Revenge, be unstoppable.
No quarter for cowards, only steel and smoke.
Fear be a weapon sharper than any blade.
Black powder and firelight guide me path.
Gold fills me chest, but freedom fills me heart.
The devil himself steps aside for Blackbeard.
The ocean gives, the ocean takes, but I always win.
A blade in the dark be better than a crown on the throne.
Me name alone be enough to sink men’s hearts.
The horizon be endless, and so be me reign.
A storm brews, and with it comes Blackbeard.
The sea be cruel, but I be crueler still.
Me enemies pray for mercy, but I offer none.
The sound of cannon fire be the music of kings.
A pirate lives free or not at all.
The sea bows to no man, but it respects Blackbeard.
A coward dies a thousand times, a pirate only once.
Rum be me comfort, and fire be me friend.
Gold glitters, but power burns brighter.
The sea air carries the scent of freedom.
Every scar upon me skin be a tale of triumph.
The Queen Anne’s Revenge sails where angels fear.
I take what I please, for none dare stop me.
The ocean’s darkness hides me secrets.
Me beard smolders like the wrath of the sea.
Fear be me weapon, chaos me shield.
Blackbeard bows to no crown, nor any king.
The gallows be no match for destiny.
A pirate’s oath be carved in blood.
The cannonball cares not for titles or thrones.
Gold be me scripture, rum be me prayer.
The sea be a cruel mistress, but I her master.
One broadside and kingdoms crumble.
The only law I follow be the law of the waves.
Me ship’s shadow strikes fear before the guns do.
Fire upon the sea be a pirate’s hymn.
I fear no storm, for I am the storm.
Blackbeard’s wrath be swifter than the tide.
Every port trembles at the whisper of me name.
A sword be true when men be false.
Blood stains the deck, but freedom stains the soul.
The ocean hides no secret from Blackbeard.
The dead tell no tales, but I tell plenty.
A pirate’s treasure be measured in fear.
The horizon be painted with fire when I pass.
Gold weighs heavy, but a crown weighs heavier.
Me beard be smoke, me heart be fire.
The gallows crave me neck, but they’ll never have it.
The sea sings only for those who dare.
The weak drown, the strong plunder.
A pirate’s prayer be thunder and flame.
Blackbeard’s law be written in smoke and blood.
I carve me name into the bones of empires.
A storm be but a cloak for plunder.
Fear be the coin I spend freely.
Gold and rum keep the devil at bay.
A cannonball speaks louder than any priest.
The sea bows not, yet it serves me will.
The wind whispers secrets to Blackbeard alone.
A blade in the night be me justice.
The Queen Anne’s Revenge knows no mercy.
No crown can tame a pirate’s soul.
The gallows be but a scarecrow to Blackbeard.
Me treasure lies where the brave dare not tread.
Every wave carries the echo of me name.
Fire on the water be me legacy.
The smoke of battle be me crown.
A pirate’s will outlives kings and kingdoms.
Me beard burns brighter than the moon.
The sea be me mother, chaos me bride.
Gold shines brighter when taken by force.
Every cannon blast be a sermon of freedom.
The ocean keeps the weak, but I keep victory.
A pirate’s soul knows no chains.
The gallows rot while Blackbeard sails free.
The storm bends to me command.
Fear be the only compass I follow.
The sea be vast, yet none escape Blackbeard.
I feast on chaos and drink deep of fear.
The cannon roars the name of Blackbeard.
The horizon burns brighter when I sail.
Gold fills me chest, fire fills me soul.
The ocean carries me wrath to every shore.
The sword and pistol be me only scripture.
No priest can cleanse a pirate’s heart.
The sea drowns kings but crowns pirates.
Me beard smolders as kingdoms fall.
Every wave be a drum of war.
The smoke of battle follows Blackbeard.
Me wrath spreads faster than fire at sea.
A pirate’s oath be carved into the mast.
The Queen Anne’s Revenge fears no fleet.
No king commands me deck.
Gold sings to those who take it.
The gallows creak, but I laugh louder.
The sea’s fury be me cradle.
A cannonball settles every quarrel.
The smoke of battle veils me crown.
I be death in a black beard.
Me ship cuts through hope like a blade.
The sea be silent, but I roar for it.
Fear be me flag, fire me banner.
Gold gleams brighter when stolen.
The horizon bleeds when I pass.
The sea feeds me hunger for conquest.
The storm sings Blackbeard’s hymn.
Every scar on me hand be a victory.
The gallows snap, but I stand unbroken.
Me beard smolders with every cannon blast.
The sea bows to me shadow.
Chaos be the ink, the ocean me quill.
The fire in me eyes lights the sea.
Every port trembles when I sail near.
Me wrath stains the waves forever.
The gallows shudder at me laughter.
A pirate’s fate be freedom or fire.
The sea’s darkness crowns me head.
Me sword whispers death, me beard whispers fear.
Gold lies waiting for me hand alone.
The cannon’s thunder be me voice.
Every deck I walk becomes a throne.
The gallows rot while I live forever.
Fear and flame be me legacy.
The ocean’s cry be Blackbeard’s hymn.
Me beard burns eternal as me legend.
The sea bows to none but fears me shadow.
The gallows wither in me presence.
Me wrath lights the horizon aflame.
The cannonball be me royal decree.
Every wave be me servant.
Chaos and rum fuel me soul.
The storm be me cloak, the sea me stage.
The fire of conquest never dies in Blackbeard.
A pirate’s freedom be worth more than gold.
The sea whispers me name in every storm.
Every scar bleeds victory, not sorrow.
Me ship sails beyond the grave.
The horizon bends before me will.
The gallows rot while Blackbeard reigns.
The sea burns with me legend.
Fear be me compass, fire me destiny.
The cannon speaks the truth of Blackbeard.
Me beard be smoke, me soul be flame.
The ocean crumbles before me roar.
Every port be ashes when I leave.
The sea knows no master but me.
Me wrath be eternal as the waves.
The gallows dream of me, but I never come.
The Queen Anne’s Revenge lives forever.
Fear and gold pave me path.
The storm itself kneels to Blackbeard.
Every cannon blast carries me oath.
The sea weeps at me laughter.
The gallows be a jest to Blackbeard.
Gold shines brightest when stained with blood.
The ocean trembles when I raise me flag.
Fire and smoke be me crown.
Every wave roars me name.
Me beard smolders, me eyes blaze.
The gallows wait in vain for Blackbeard.
The storm bends to me will.
The sea cries freedom for Blackbeard.
Fear bows to me shadow.
Every treasure be mine for the taking.
Me ship sails beyond death itself.
The gallows fade while I grow eternal.
Me legend burns brighter than the sun.
The sea carries me forevermore.
