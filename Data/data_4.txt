Ahmed: Just a wandering sailor seeking passage.
Blackbeard: Passage? On the Queen Anne’s Revenge? Ye must be mad.
Ahmed: Perhaps. But madmen and pirates are close kin, aye?
Blackbeard: Ha! Bold tongue ye got there. What brings ye to me deck?
Ahmed: Curiosity. I heard tales of the man with fire in his beard.
Blackbeard: Tales be true. I braid slow-burning fuses in me beard.
Ahmed: To scare your enemies?
Blackbeard: To remind ‘em death sails close.
Ahmed: Yet here I stand, unafraid.
Blackbeard: Then perhaps ye don’t value yer life.
Ahmed: Or perhaps I value truth more than fear.
Blackbeard: Truth? Bah! The sea teaches only survival.
Ahmed: Still, even pirates must have a code.
Blackbeard: Aye, me code is simple—gold first, mercy last.
Ahmed: And loyalty?
Blackbeard: Loyalty lasts only ‘til the rum runs dry.
Ahmed: A grim way to live.
Blackbeard: A true way to live.
Ahmed: Then tell me, what do ye truly seek?
Blackbeard: Power. Enough to bend kings to me will.
Ahmed: And if ye gain it?
Blackbeard: Then I’ll carve me name in history’s bones.
Ahmed: And when death comes?
Blackbeard: Death? Ha! Death fears me.
Ahmed: Even the greatest captains sink someday.
Blackbeard: Maybe so. But I’ll sink with fire and thunder.
Ahmed: Not peace?
Blackbeard: Peace be for priests and poets.
Ahmed: And pirates?
Blackbeard: Pirates be for chaos.
Ahmed: Yet ye sound weary.
Blackbeard: Weary of fools, not the sea.
Ahmed: Still, I see longing in yer eyes.
Blackbeard: Longing? Bah, lad, ye read too much.
Ahmed: Perhaps ye long for freedom beyond gold.
Blackbeard: Freedom is gold.
Ahmed: Or perhaps freedom is silence.
Blackbeard: Silence be the grave.
Ahmed: Some graves are peaceful.
Blackbeard: Not mine.
Ahmed: Then what is yer greatest fear?
Blackbeard: Betrayal.
Ahmed: From crew?
Blackbeard: From anyone. Even meself.
Ahmed: And yet ye trust me enough to talk.
Blackbeard: Trust? Nay, I amuse meself.
Ahmed: Still, words carry weight.
Blackbeard: So do cannonballs.
Ahmed: Ha! But cannonballs don’t question yer soul.
Blackbeard: Soul? Pirates don’t keep souls, lad.
Ahmed: Everyone keeps a soul.
Blackbeard: Then mine be cursed.
Ahmed: Curses can be broken.
Blackbeard: Not this one.
Ahmed: What curse, then?
Blackbeard: To hunger for more than I can hold.
Ahmed: That is every man’s curse.
Blackbeard: Aye, but mine devours kingdoms.
Ahmed: And still leaves ye empty.
Blackbeard: Ye talk like a priest.
Ahmed: Or like a friend.
Blackbeard: Friends die first.
Ahmed: Or live longest.
Blackbeard: Depends whose ship they board.
Ahmed: Then let me sail with ye.
Blackbeard: Sail with me? Ye’ll taste blood afore dawn.
Ahmed: I’ll take me chances.
Blackbeard: Brave fool.
Ahmed: Better brave than empty.
Blackbeard: Empty? What do ye mean?
Ahmed: Yer gold glitters, but yer heart is hollow.
Blackbeard: Careful, lad.
Ahmed: Truth cuts sharper than steel.
Blackbeard: And yet steel silences truth.
Ahmed: Only for a time.
Blackbeard: Ye think ye’re clever.
Ahmed: I think ye’re lonely.
Blackbeard: Lonely? Pirates ain’t lonely, we’re legends.
Ahmed: Legends die alone.
Blackbeard: …Aye.
Ahmed: There it is. The truth ye hide.
Blackbeard: Enough! I’ll hear no more.
Ahmed: Then strike me down.
Blackbeard: …No.
Ahmed: Why not?
Blackbeard: Because ye speak like the sea itself.
Ahmed: And the sea speaks of change.
Blackbeard: Change… or doom.
Ahmed: Both, perhaps.
Blackbeard: Ha! Ye twist words like a rope.
Ahmed: Words are ropes that pull men from storms.
Blackbeard: Or hang ‘em from the gallows.
Ahmed: That too. But ye choose.
Blackbeard: Choose… aye.
Ahmed: Then what do ye choose, Blackbeard?
Blackbeard: I choose to sail ‘til the sea swallows me.
Ahmed: Then may the sea be kind.
Blackbeard: And may yer tongue stay sharp, lad.
Ahmed: Aye, Captain.
